    <em>
    <h2>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the most basic language, and simple to learn and modify. It is a combination of both hypertext and markup language. It contains the elements that can change/develop a web page’s look and the displayed contents. Or we can say that HTML creates or defines the structure of web pages. We can create websites using HTML which can be viewed on internet-connected devices like laptops, android mobile phones, etc. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first version of HTML is HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999, and the latest version is HTML 5. We can save HTML files with an extension .html.

        What is Hypertext?
        
        Text that is not restricted to a sequential format and that includes links to other text is called Hypertext. The links can connect online pages inside a single or different website. 
        
        What is Markup Language?
        
        Markup Language is a language that is interpreted by the browser and it defines the elements within a document using “tags”. It is human-readable, which means that markup files use common words rather than the complicated syntax of programming languages. </h2>
